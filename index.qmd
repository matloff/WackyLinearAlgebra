Unconventional linear algebra textbook, doing everything "backwards." 

The presentation of each concept begins with a problem to be solved,
leading up to a linear algebra solution. Basically, the math sneaks up
on the reader, who suddenly realizes they've just learned a new general
concept!

## Prerequisite background

Calculus and some exposure to R. 

For a quick, painless introduction to R, see my
[fasteR](https://github.com/matloff/fasteR) tutorial, say the first 8
lessons.
