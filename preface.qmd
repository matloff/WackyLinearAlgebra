Welcome to my magnum opus! :-) I've written a number of books, but
consider this one to be the most important.  [This work is licensed

### Subtlety in the Title

Let's start with the title of this book, "Linear Algebra *in* 
Data Science." It would be more typical of "math support for field X"
books to use "for" rather than "in," but the use of the latter aims to
emphasize the fact that:

<blockquote>

Linear algebra is absolutely fundamental to the Data Science field. For
us data scientists, it is "our" branch of math. Mastering this branch,
which is definitely within the reach of all, pays major dividends.

</blockquote>

### Philosophy

This is an unconventional linear algebra textbook, doing everything
"backwards." The presentation of each concept begins with a problem to
be solved, almost always from Data Science, leading up to a linear
algebra solution.  Basically, the math sneaks up on the reader, who
suddenly realizes they've just learned a new general concept!

An excellent [review of book on Principal Components
Analysis](https://loreley.one/2024-09-pca/). The reviewer writes

<blockquote>

I bought the acclaimed *Linear Algebra Done Right*...A
classic. Used by students all over the world. I slogged through the
early chapters. It was rather dull, one definition after another. It is
not difficult to follow the logic, and to see how one theorem follows
from another. But the entire enterprise was draining and unfulfilling.
It felt random. “Follow these steps and you get the result you are
looking for. I can prove that it works because of the following …”. But
why does it work? What possessed you to follow this path as opposed to
any other? How might I have come up with this myself? The book provided
no answers and I was left feeling deeply unsatisfied.

</blockquote>

The fundamental philosophy of my book here is to avoid such reader
frustration.

### Who is this book for?

Of course the book should work well as a course textbook. The
"applications first" approach should motivate student, and the use of
Quarto enables easy conversion to Powerpoint by instructors.

I hope the book's emphasis on the Why? and How?  especially appeals to
do-it-yourselfers, those who engagement in self-study is motivated by
intellectual curiosity rather than a course grade.

### Prerequisite background

Basic data science:

* Calculus.  

* Some exposure to R is recommended, but the text can be read
without it.[For a quick, painless introduction to R, see my
[fasteR](https://github.com/matloff/fasteR) tutorial, say the first 8
lessons.]{.column-margin}

* Basics of random variables, expected value and variance.
