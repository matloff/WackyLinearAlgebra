# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome to my magnum opus! :-) I've written a number of books, but
consider this one to be the most important.  [This work is licensed

### Subtlety in the Title

Let's start with the title of this book, "Linear Algebra *in* 
Data Science." It would be more typical of "math support for field X"
books to use "for" rather than "in," but the use of the latter aims to
emphasize the fact that:

<blockquote>

Linear algebra is absolutely fundamental to the Data Science field. For
us data scientists, it is "our" branch of math. Mastering this branch,
which is definitely within the reach of all, pays major dividends.

</blockquote>

### Philosophy

This is an unconventional linear algebra textbook, doing everything
"backwards." The presentation of each concept begins with a problem to
be solved, almost always from Data Science, leading up to a linear
algebra solution.  Basically, the math sneaks up on the reader, who
suddenly realizes they've just learned a new general concept!

### Who is this book for?

Of course the book should work well as a course textbook. The
"applications first" approach should motivate student, and the use of
Quarto enables easy conversion to Powerpoint by instructors.

I hope the book's emphasize on the Why? and How?  especially appeals to
do-it-yourselfers, those who engagement in self-study is motivated by
intellectual curiosity rather than a course grade.

### Prerequisite background

Basic data science:

* Calculus.  

* Some exposure to R is recommended, but the text can be read
without it.[For a quick, painless introduction to R, see my
[fasteR](https://github.com/matloff/fasteR) tutorial, say the first 8
lessons.]{.column-margin}

* Basics of random variables, expected value and variance.
