Welcome to my magnum opus! :-) I've written a number of books, but
consider this one to be the most important.  [This work is licensed

### Subtlety in the Title

Let's start with the title of this book, "Linear Algebra *Rules* 
Data Science." It would be more typical of "math support for field X"
books to use "for" rather than "in," but the use of the latter aims to
emphasize the fact that:

<blockquote>

Linear algebra is absolutely fundamental to the Data Science field. For
us data scientists, it is "our" branch of math. Mastering this branch,
which is definitely within the reach of all, pays major dividends.

</blockquote>

### Philosophy

This is an unconventional linear algebra textbook, doing everything
"backwards." The presentation of each concept begins with a problem to
be solved, almost always from Data Science, leading up to a linear
algebra solution.  Basically, the math sneaks up on the reader, who
suddenly realizes they've just learned a new general concept!

In an excellent [review of book on Principal Components
Analysis](https://loreley.one/2024-09-pca/), the reviewer writes

<blockquote>

I bought the acclaimed *Linear Algebra Done Right*...A classic...It was
rather dull, one definition after another. It is not difficult to follow
the logic, and to see how one theorem follows from another. But...it
felt random.  “Follow these steps and you get the result you are looking
for. I can prove that it works because of the following …”. But why does
it work?  What possessed you to follow this path as opposed to any
other? How might I have come up with this myself? The book provided no
answers and I was left feeling deeply unsatisfied.

</blockquote>

The fundamental philosophy of my book here is to avoid such reader
frustration.

### Who is this book for?

Of course the book should work well as a classroom textbook. The
"applications first" approach should motivate students, and the use of
Quarto enables easy conversion to Powerpoint by instructors.

But I also hope the book's emphasis on the Why? and How?  especially
appeals to do-it-yourselfers, those whose engagement in self-study is
motivated by intellectual curiosity rather than a course grade.

### Prerequisite background

Basic data science:

* Calculus.  

* Some exposure to R is recommended, but the text can be read
without it.[For a quick, painless introduction to R, see my
[fasteR](https://github.com/matloff/fasteR) tutorial, say the first 8
lessons.]{.column-margin}

* Basics of random variables, expected value and variance.

### The role of theory

::: {.callout-important}

## This book is "mathematical but not very theoretical."

Theorems are mainly limited to results with practical importance, and
proofs are sometimes rather informal. But the subject matter is indeed
mathematical. The goal is to develop in the reader mathematical skill
and intuition into this powerful tool, rather than coding of linear algebra
methods.
