Welcome to my magnum opus! :-) I've written a number of books, but
consider this one to be the most important.  [This work is licensed

## Subtlety in the Title

Let's start with the title of this book, "Powered by Linear Algebra: The
central role of matrices and vector spaces in Data Science." It's
important to understand why the title is NOT "Linear Algebra for Data
Scientists." That latter would connote that people in Data Science
(DS)will first learn linear algebra purely as a branch of math in this
book, with no hint of connections to DS, then apply that knowledge in
subsequent DS courses. Instead, the goal in the title is to emphasize
the fact that:

> Linear algebra is absolutely fundamental to the Data Science field.
> For us data scientists, it is "our" branch of math.  Almost every
> concept in this book is first motivated by a Data Science application.
> Mastering this branch of math, which is definitely within the reach of
> all, pays major dividends.

## Philosophy

*I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of
something and knowing something* -- physicist Richard Feynman 

*...it felt random.  "Follow these steps and you get the
result you are looking for." But why does it work?  What possessed you
to follow this path as opposed to any other? How might I have come up
with this myself?* -- [comment](https://loreley.one/2024-09-pca) by
a reader of a famous linear algebra book

A fundamental philosophy of my book here is to avoid such reader
frustration. It's easy to define, say the dimension of a vector
subspace, but that's definitely not enough. What is the underlying
intuition? Why is the concept important, especially in Data Science?

The presentation of each concept in this book begins with a problem to
be solved, almost always from Data Science, then leading up to a linear
algebra solution.  Basically, the math sneaks up on the reader, who
suddenly realizes they've just learned a new general concept! And the
reader knows where the concept fits into the Big Picture, and can
distill the abstraction into an intuitive summary.

Above all, this book does not allow rote memorization, merely "knowing
the name of something." The focus on How? and Why? is on every page.

## Who Is This Book For?

Of course the book should work well as a classroom textbook. The
"applications first" approach should motivate students, and the use of
Quarto enables easy conversion to Powerpoint by instructors.

But I also hope the book's emphasis on the How? and Why? especially
appeals to do-it-yourselfers, those whose engagement in self-study is
motivated by intellectual curiosity rather than a course grade.

## Prerequisite Background

Basic data science:

* Calculus.  

* Some exposure to R is recommended, but the text can be read
without it.[For a quick, painless introduction to R, see my
[fasteR](https://github.com/matloff/fasteR) tutorial, say the first 8
lessons.]{.column-margin}

* Basics of random variables, expected value and variance.

## The Role of Theory (and R)

::: {.callout-important}

## This book is "mathematical but not very theoretical."

Theorems are mainly limited to results with practical importance, and
proofs are sometimes rather informal. But the subject matter is indeed
mathematical. The goal is to develop in the reader mathematical skill
and intuition into this powerful tool, rather than coding of linear algebra
methods.

Thus the many R examples are meant to make the mathematical concepts
concrete. This is definitely not an "how to do linear algebra in R"
book.  In the software context, the Feynman quote above might be,
"Knowing how to use code libraries for something is useless if one
doesn't understand the nature of that thing."
