# Shrinkage Estimators 

::: {.callout-note}

## Goals of this chapter:

In the previous chapter, we introduced the norm of a vector. In many
data science applications, solutions with smaller norms may be more
accurate. This point is explored here.

:::
## Multicollinearity{#sec-nearly}

The notion of *multicollinearity* was the original motivation for
shrinkage estimators. It refers to settings in which the following
concerns arise:

* One column of the matrix $A$ in @eq-linregformula is nearly equal to
  some linear combination of the others.

* Thus $A$ is nearly not of full rank.

* Thus $A'A$ is nearly not of full rank.

* Thus $\widehat{\beta}$ is unstable, in the form of high variance.

That latter point is often quantified by the *Variance Inflation
Factor*. To motivate it, consider the "R-squared" value
from linear regression analyis, which is the squared correlation between
true "Y" and predicted "Y". Let $R^2_j$ denote that measure in the case of
predicting column $j$ of $A$ from the other columns. The quantity

$$
VIF_j = \frac{1}{1-R^2_j}
$$

then measures the negative impact due to multicollinearity on estimating 
$\widehat{\beta}_j$. The intuition is that, say, column 3 of $A$ can be
predicted well using a linear model, then that column is approximately
equal to a linear combination of the other "X" columns. This is worrisome in
light of the problems described above.

Needless to say, the word "nearly" above, e.g. in "nearly not of full
rank," is vague, and leaves open the question of "What can we do about
it?" We will present several answers to these questions in this and the
succeeding chapters.

## Example: Million Song Dataset{#sec-millionsong}

Let's consider the Million Song Dataset, varous versions of which are on
the Web. 

Ours is a 50,000-line subset of the one with 515345 rows and 91
columns. The first column is the year of release, followed by 90 columns
of various audio measurements. The goal is to predict the year, **V1**,
from the audio variables **V2** through **V91**.

The function **regclass::VIF** will compute the VIF values for us.

```{r}
library(WackyData)
data(MillSong50K) # loads s50
lmout <- lm(V1 ~ .,data=s50)
library(regclass)
VIF(lmout)
```

As a rough guide, values of VIF about 5.0 are considered concerning by
many analysts. Under that criterion, variables **V5**, **V7**, **V17**
and so on look troublesome.

What can be done? One simple approach would be to delete those columns
from the dataset. This is indeed is a common solution, but another is
*ridge regression*, which we present next.

## Ridge Regression

In seminal paper, Hoerl and Kennard[*Technometrids*,
Februaru1970]{.column-margin} presented a new approach to the problem of
multicollinearity of predictor variables in a linear model.  


### The ridge solution

Their solution is simple; Add some quantity to the diagonal of $A'A$.
Specifically, @eq-linregformula now becomes

$$
\widehat{\beta} = (A'A + \lambda I)^{-1} A'S
$${#eq-ridge}

where $\lambda$ is a positive number chosen by the analyst.

Here $A$ has dimensions $n \textrm{ x } p$, and $I$ is the $p \textrm{ x } p$
identity matrix.

### Matrix formulation{#sec-matform}

Using partitioned matrices helps understand ridge. Replace  $A$ and $S$
by

$$
A_{new} =
 \left (
 \begin{array}{r}
 A \\
 \lambda I \\
 \end{array}
 \right )
$$

and

$$
S_{new} =
 \left (
 \begin{array}{r}
 S \\
 0 \\
 \end{array}
 \right )
$$

where 0 means $p$ 0s. In essence, we are adding artificial data here,
consisting of $p$ new rows to $A$, and $p$ new elements to $S$.
So @eq-ridge is just the result of applying @eq-linregformula to
$A_{new}$ and $S_{new}$.

Loosely speaking, we can think of the addition of $\lambda I$ to $A'A$
makes the latter "larger", and thus its inverse smaller. In other words,
we are "shrinking" $\widehat{\beta}$ towards 0. This effect is made even
stronger by the fact that we added 0s data to $S$. This will be made
more precise below.

### Example: Million Song dataset

We will use **glmnet**, one of the most widely-used R  packages.

```{r}
library(glmnet)
x <- s50[,-1]
y <- s50[,1]
glmOut <- glmnet(x,y,
             alpha=0,  # ridge
             lambda=0.1)
coef(glmOut)
```

We had earlier flagged variable $V5$ as causing multicollinearity. As
noted then, we could simply exclude it, but here under ridge, we see
that it has been assigned a very small regression coefficient compared
to most others. 

So, did the estimated coefficient vector shrink?

```{r}
l2norm <- function(x) sqrt(sum(x^2))
bh01<- coef(glmnet(x,y,alpha=0,lambda=0.1))
l2norm(bh01)
bhOLS <- coef(lm(V1 ~ .,s50))
l2norm(bhOLS)
```

No, the vector got larger!

The culprit is the intercept term, $\widehat{\beta}_0$:

```{r}
bh01[1]
bhOLS[1]
l2norm(bh01[-1])
l2norm(bhOLS[-1])
```

The rest of the vector did shrink (though not necessily
element-by-element).

Actually, we should have centered and scaled "X" before applying ridge,
since the predictors are of such different magnitudes. This also makes
the intercept 0.

```{r}
s50a <- s50
s50a[,-1] <- scale(s50[,-1])
s50a[,1] <- s50a[,1] - mean(s50a[,1])
bh01<- coef(glmnet(s50a[,-1],s50a[,1],alpha=0,lambda=0.1))
l2norm(bh01)
bhOLS <- coef(lm(V1 ~ .,s50a))
l2norm(bhOLS)

```

## Choosing the Value of $\lambda$

So, how do we choose $\lambda$? We need to note a couple of very
important principles first.

### Two key general statistical properties

::: {.callout-note}
Subtracting the mean of a variable from that variable results in a
mean-0 entity. In the linear regression context, centering both "X" and
"Y" will result in the model having 0 as its intercept term.
:::

::: {#nte-monkeys .callout-note}

In a set of 10,000 randomly typing monkeys, one of them will
accidentally type a Shakespearian sonnet. 

Some readers have heard this before in the context of *p-hacking*,
in which an analyst poses a large collection of research questions, and
runs a statistical hypothesis on each of them. Even if the null
hypothesis is true for all of them, each will have a 5% chance of being
[One should not be doing hypothesis tests in the first place. See [these notes](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/qeML/vignettes/NoPValues.html).]{.column-margin}
rejected, and since there are many, the chance that at least one will be
rejected and declared "significant."


This problem arises in many, many Data Science contexts, and a good
analyst must be vigilant to recognize the potential to mislead.

:::

### Cross-validation{#sec-xval}

A common way to choose among models is *cross-validation*: We set aside
[Some analysts break the data into three sets, including a *validation set*, considered even "fresher."]{.column-margin}
a subset of the data, known as the *holdout* or *test* set, for use in
testing predictive accuracy.  The remaining data is the *training set*.
For each of our competing models -- in this case, competing values of
$\lambda$ -- we fit the model on the training set, then use the result
to predict the test set. We then use whichever model does best in the
test set.

The test set serves as "fresh data," simulating how our fitted model
might do in the real world (assuming our data is representative of the
real world). Predicting on the training set is not as good, since our
fit was by design tailored to that data.

## Example: Million Song Data

``` r
> library(glmnet)
> glmOut <- cv.glmnet(x=as.matrix(s50[,-1]),y=s50$V1,alpha=0)
> glmOut
    Lambda Index Measure     SE Nonzero
min 0.2474   100   89.44 0.9201      90
1se 0.9987    85   90.28 0.9823      90
```

The $\lambda$ value that gave the smallest Mean Squared Prediction Error
(MSE) was 0.2474. (Coincidentally, it was also the smallest value that
the function tried; see **glmOut$lambda**.) A more conservative value of
$\lambda$ was 0.9987, the largest $\lambda$ giving MSE within one
standard error of the minimum; it's conservative in the sense of being
less likely to overfit; its MSE value, 90.28, was only slightly larger
than the best one. In each case, all 90 predictors had nonzero
coefficient estimates.

We can then predict as usual. Say we have a song similar to that in
**s50[1,]**, but with **V2** equal to 25.0.

```{r}
z <- s50[1,-1]  # exclude Y
z[1,1] <- 25.0
predict(glmOut,z)
```

The year of release is predicted to be 2003.

## Modern View{#sec-pgtn}

There are many ways to deal with multicollinearity other than shrinkage,
and indeed, these days one seldom hears mention of multicollinearity in
discussions of shrinkage. Instead, the goal is *dimension reduction*,
meaning to reduce the complexity of a model in order to avoid
overfitting; the LASSO, introduced below, does this explicitly, while
ridge accomplishes it via pure size reduction.

We will discuss this further in @sec-dimred, but one more point about
the discussion no longer being motivated explicitly by
multicollinearity: One can apply ridge to situations of **exact**
dependence among the columns of X, as opposed to the original motivation
of dealing with *approximate* linear dependence.  in which there is
*exact* linear dependence.

We saw such a setting in @sec-censusrref. There we deliberately induced
exact linear dependence by inclusion of both male and female dummy
variables. Let's apply ridge:

```{r}
library(qeML) 
data(svcensus) 
svc <- svcensus[,c(1,4:6)]  
svc$man <- as.numeric(svc$gender == 'male') 
svc$woman <- as.numeric(svc$gender == 'female') 
svc$gender <- NULL 
a <- svc[,-2] 
lambda <- 0.1 
a <- as.matrix(a) 
tmp1 <- solve(t(a) %*% a + lambda * diag(4)) 
tmp1 %*% t(a) %*% as.matrix(svc$wageinc) 
```

The results essentially are the same as what we obtained by having only
one dummy, thus no linear dependence: Men still enjoy about an \$11,000
advantage. But ridge allowed us to avoid deleting one of our dummies.
Such deletion is easy in this case, but for large $p$, say in the
hundreds or even more, some analysts prefer the convenience of ridge.

## Formalizing the Notion of Shrinkage

How in the world did statisticians develop an interest in shrinking
estimators? A watershed event occurred in the early 1980s, when the
statistical world was shocked by research by James and Stein that found,
in short that:

<blockquote>

Say $W$ has $q$-dimensional normal distribution with mean vector $\mu$
and independent components having variance $\sigma^2$, each. We have a
random sample of size $n$, i.e. $n$ independent observations on $W$.
Then if $q \geq 3$, in terms of Mean Squared Estimation Error, the best
estimator of $\mu$ is NOT the sample mean $\bar{W}$. Instead, it's

$$
\left (
1 - \frac{(q-2) \sigma^2/n}{||\bar{W}||^2} 
\right )
\bar{W}
$$

</blockquote>

The quantity within the parentheses is typically smaller than 1, giving
us the shrinkage property. Note, though, that with larger $n$, the
amount of shrinkage is minor.

In the case of linear regression, shrinkage works there too, with $q$
being the number of columns in the $A$ matrix. 

So, let's view the issue of shrinkage more formally, first  for ridge
and later for the LASSO.

### Shrinkage through length penalization

Say instead of minimizing @eq-matrixss, we minimize

$$
(S - Ab)'(S - Ab) + \lambda ||b||^2 
$${#eq-matrixssridge}

The larger $b$ is, the harder it is to minimize the overall quantity
@eq-matrixssridge. We say that we *penalize* large values of $b$,
an indirect way of pursuing shrinkage. Now take the derivative and set
to 0:

$$
0 = A'(S-Ab) + \lambda b
$${#eq-ridgederiv}

i.e.

$$
(A'A + \lambda I) b = A'S
$$ 

and thus

$$
\widehat{\beta} = (A'A+\lambda I)^{-1} A'S
$$

It's ridge! So ridge, originally motivated by "almost singular"
settings, actually turns out to justify ridge as a shrinkage estimator..

### Shrinkage through length limitation

Instead of penalizing $||b||$, we could simply constrain it, i.e. we
could set our optimization problem to:

<blockquote>

minimize $(S-Ab)'(S-Ab)$, subject to the constraint $||b||^2 \leq \gamma$

</blockquote>

We say that this new formulation is the *dual* of the first one. One can
show that they are typically equivalent.

## The LASSO

The LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) was
developed by Robert Tibshirani in 1996, following earlier work by Leo
Breiman.  It takes $\widehat{\beta}$ to be the value of $b$ that
minimizes

$$
(S - Ab)'(S - Ab) + \lambda ||b||_1
$${#eq-matrixsslasso}

where the "l1 norm" is 

$$
||b|| = \sum_{i=1}^p |b_i|
$$

We will write our original norm as $||b||_2$.

This is a seemingly minor change, but with important implications.  What
Breiman and Tibshirani were trying to do was to obtain a *sparse*
$\widehat{\beta}$ , i.e. a solution with lots of 0s, thereby providing a
method for predictor variable selection. This is important because
so-called "parsimonious" prediction models are desirable.

### Properties

To that end, first note that it can be shown that, under some technical
conditions, that the ridge solution minimizes 

$$
(S - Ab)'(S - Ab) 
$$

subject to the constraint

$$
||b||_2 \leq \gamma
$$

while in the LASSO case the constraint is

$$
||b||_1 \leq \gamma
$$

As with $\lambda$ in the original formulation, $\gamma$ is a positive
number chosen by the analyst.

## Ridge vs. LASSO for Dimension Reduction{#sec-dimred}

Today's large datasets being so common, we need a way to "cut things
down to size," i.e. *dimension reduction*, aimed at reducing the number
of predictor variables. This is done both for the sake of simplicity and
to over *overfitting*, in which fitting an overly complex model can
reduce predictive power.

### Geometric view

Comparison between the ridge and LASSO concepts is often done via this
graph depicting the LASSO setting:

![LASSO sparsity](LASSO_gray.png)

Here $p = 2$, with $b = (b_1,b_2)'$. The horizontal and vertical axes
represent $b_1$ and $b_2$.  

* The constraint $||b||_1 \leq \gamma$ then takes the form of a diamond,
  with corners at 
  $(\gamma,0)$, 
  $(0,\gamma)$, 
  $(-\gamma,0)$ and
  $(0,-\gamma)$. The constraint $||b||_1 \leq \gamma$
  requires us to choose a point $b$ somewhere in the
  diamond, including the boundary.

* Note that each of the four corners of the diamond represents a sparse
  solution. For instance, the point $(0,\gamma)$ has $b_2 = 0$

* The concentric ellipses depict the values of $c(b) = (S - Ab)'(S -
  Ab)$, as follows.  

* Consider one particular value of $c(b)$, say 1.68. 

* Many different points $b$ in the graph will have $c(b) = 1.68$; in
  fact, the locus of all such points is an ellipse.  

* There is one ellipse for each possible value of $c(b)$. So, there are
  infinitely many ellipses, though only two are shown here.

* Larger values of $c(b)$ yield larger ellipses.

* On the one hand, we want to choose a $b$ for which $c(b)$ -- our total
  squared prediction error -- is small, thus a smaller ellipse. 

* But on the other hand, we need at least one point on the ellipse to 
  be in common with the diamond.  

* The solution is then a point $b$ in which the ellipse
  just barely touches the diamond.

* Picture in your mind an ellipse, say the inner one in the graph,
  growing larger and larger, while retaining the same center and
  orientation, until it hits the diamond. That is the outer ellipse,
  which indeed hits the diamond at one of the corners.

* Then picture other ellipses, at other centers with other orientations,
  and go through the same process in your mind's eye. You will see that
  [Of course, we are in just two dimensions here. With $p = 10$ predictor variables, the graph would be in 10 dimensions, beyond our human ability to picture. But we still would have a diamong in that space, with $2p$ corners etc.]{.column-margin}
  typically the solution turns out to be one of the corners. Again, this
  is important because it gives us a sparse solution.

### Implication for dimension reduction.

The key point is that that "barely touching" point 
will be one of the four corners of the diamond, points at which either
$b_1 = 0$ or $b_2 = 0$ -- *hence a sparse solution*, meaning one in
which many/most of the coefficients in the fitted model will be 0. This
achieves the goal of dimension reduction.

Ridge will not produce a sparse solution. The diamond would now be a
circle (not shown). The "barely touching point" will almost certainly
will be at a place in which both $b_1$ and $b_2$ are nonzero. Hence no
sparsity.

### Avoidance of overfitting *without* dimension reduction

As we've seen, both ridge and LASSO reduce the size of the
$\widehat{\beta}$ vector of estimated coefficients. Smaller quantities
have smaller statistical variances, hence a guard against overfitting.
So, even ridge can be employed as an approach to the overfitting
problem, even though it does not provide a sparse solution.

On the other hand, in some settings, it may be desirable to keep all
predictors, as seen in the next section.

## Example: NYC Taxi Data{#sec-useall}

The purpose of this data is to predict trip time in the New York City
taxi system. The $qeML$ package includes a 10,000-row subset.

```{r}
library(qeML)
data(nyctaxi)
head(nyctaxi)
dim(nyctaxi)
length(unique(nyctaxi$PULocationID))
length(unique(nyctaxi$DOLocationID))
```

If we fit, say, a linear model, $lm$ will form a dummy variable for each
of the pickup and dropoff locations. Thus we will have $p = 1+143+205+1 = 350$. 
An old rule of thumb says that if we have $p$ predictors and $n$ data
points, we should keep $p < \sqrt{n}$ to avoid overfitting. As we will
see in a later chapter, these days that rule is being questioned, so
[The problem would be even worse if we add  pickup/dropoff location interaction variables, basically products of the pickup and dropoff dummy variables.]{.column-margin} since here we have $\sqrt{n} = 100$, there is a strong suggestion that
we do some dimension reduction.

Thus we either should delete some of the pickup and dropoff variables,
or use all of them but temper the fit using ridge. The latter may be
more attractive, as riders would like a time estimate for their
particular pickup and dropoff locations.

```{r}
library(glmnet)
nycwide <- factorsToDummies(nyctaxi[,-1])
glmOut <- cv.glmnet(x=nycwide,y=nyctaxi[,1],alpha=0)
glmOut
```

The best $\lambda$ value was found to be 0.3002.

## Other Shrinkage Estimators

The huge popular success of the LASSO inspired applying shrinkage to
lots of other estimators. We will give an example in @sec-svd.

## Iterative Calculation{#sec-iter}

An advantage of ridge over LASSO and other l1 shrinkage estimators is
that the former has an explicit (we day *closed-form*) solution, which
is not the case for the LASSO. In fact, many algorithms in
statistics/machine learning lack closed-form solutions, in which case
one must resort to *iterative* computation.

The basis idea is to first (somehow) make some guess as to the value
of the desired quantity, say $\widehat{\beta}$ in the LASSO. The
algorithm crunches this to make a new guess, hopefully one that is more
accurate than the first. One continues this process until, hopefully, it
*converges*, meaning that it no longer changes much from one iteration
to the next. The current guess is then deemed to be the correct value.
(In **glmnet**, the argument **thresh** defines what we mean by "no
longer changes much.")

At first one may think that such internal details of computation need
not concern the end user of the software. But the fact is that often an
algorithm will fail to converge, and the user may need to get more
directly involved, say in suggesting the value of the initial guess.
Or, as we will see later, some machine learning algorithm have a
parameter called the *learning rate*; a small value directs the
algorithm to take smaller steps in generating new guesses. On the one
hand, this can slow the computation but on the other, we may be less
likely to overshoot the true value.

The case of computation of the LASSO is further complicated by its being
based on the $l_1$ norm, which in turn uses absolute values, i.e. $|x|$.
These have no derivative in the calculus sense, say as used in
@eq-ridgederiv for ridge. This is a problem because many iterative
methods are based on derivatives, as follows.

Say we have a function $f$ that we wish to minimize, i.e. find $t$ such
that $f(t)$ is minimal over all $f(x)$. As we try various guesses, 
the derivative $f'(x)$ tells us the direction in which $f$ is
decreasing, exactly the information we need.

So, if say **glmnet** fails to converge, what can be done? One can
increase **thresh**, for instance, and make sure to center and scale our
X data. Tweaking other parameters may help as well, but in the end,
there are no magic solutions. It may well be that one's basic model is
flawed.

## A Warning

Many statistical quantities now have *regularized*, i.e. shrunken
versions. It is also standard practice in neural networks. This may be
quite helpful in prediction contexts. However, note the following:

::: {.callout-important}

## No Statistical Inference on Shrinkage Estimators

Shrinkage produces a bias, of unknown size. Thus classical statistical
inference (confidence intervals, hypothesis tests), e.g. those based on
@eq-varcovar for linear models, is not possible.

:::

## Your Turn

❄️  **Your Turn:** Show that $A_{new}$ in @sec-matform is of full rank, $p$.

❄️  **Your Turn:** Consider a generalization of ridge regression, in
which we find

$$
\textrm{argmin}_b ~ 
||{S} - {A} b||^2 + ||{D} b||^2
$$

for a diagonal matrix $D$. The idea is to allow different shrinkage
parameters for different predictor variables. Show that 

$$
b = 
 {[{A}' {A} + {D}^2]}^{-1}
 {A}' {S}
$$

❄️  **Your Turn:** In @sec-useall, it was pointed out that in some
settings we may prefer to retain all of our predictor variables, rather
than do dimension reduction, thus preferring ridge to LASSO. But we
might pay a price for that preference, in that the LASSO may actually
give us better predictive power. Write an R function to investigate
this, with call form

``` r
compareRidgeLASSO(data,yName)
```

where **data** and **yName** are in the format of the predictive $qeML$
functions, and the minimum Mean Squared Prediction Error is returned for
both algorithms. Try your function on some of our datasets, or others.

❄️  **Your Turn:** The LASSO will tend to produce solutions with lesser
sparsity if the dataset is large.
Write an R function to illustrate this, with call form

``` r
dependN(data,yName,n=seq(1,nrow(data),100,nReps=1)
```

where: where **data** and **yName** are in the format of the predictive
$qeML$ functions; the LASSO is applied to **n** randomly chosen rows of
**data**; and **nReps** is the number of replicates to run at each value
of **n**. The function will compute the number of nonzero elements in
the $\widehat{\beta}$ chosen by cross-validation in **cv.glmnet**.
Try your code on a few datasets.
