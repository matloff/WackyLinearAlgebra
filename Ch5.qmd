# Vector Spaces 

::: {.callout-note}

## Goals of this chapter:

As noted earlier, the two main structures in linear algebra are matrices
and vector spaces. We now introduce the latter, a bit more abstract than
matrices but even more powerful. We lay the crucial foundation in this
chapter, then reap the benefits in the applications in the remaining
chapters.

## Review of matrix rank properties

In the last chapter, we presented the concepts of matrix row and column
rank, defined to be the maximal number of linearly independent
combinations of the rows or columns of the matrix, respectively. We
proved that

<blockquote>

For any matrix $B$, 

$$
\textrm{rowrank}(B)
= \textrm{colrank}(B)
= \textrm{rowrank}(B_{rref})
= \textrm{colrank}(B_{rref})
$$

</blockquote>

We can say something stronger: 

<blockquote>

*Theorem:* Let $\cal V$ denote the set of all possible linear
combinations of rows of $B$, and define $\cal V_{rref}$ similarly. Then

$$
\cal V = \cal V_{rref}
$$

The analogous result holds for columns.

*Proof:* Actually, we already proved this in the proof regarding rank in
@sec-yessamerank, in which we wrote, 
``any nonzero linear combination of rows in $B_{rref}$ will correspond
to a nonzero linear combination of the rows of $B$,'' and vice versa.
This showed a one-to-one correspondence between the two sets of linear
combinations.

</blockquote>

So, not only do the two matrices have the same maximal numbers of 
linearly independent rows, they also generate *the same linear
combinations* of those rows.

The sets $\cal V$ and $\cal V_{rref}$ are called the *row spaces*
of the two matrices, and yes, they are examples of vector spaces, as we
will now see.

## Vector space definition

<blockquote>

A set of objects $\cal W$ is called a *vector space* if it satisfies the
following conditions:

* Some form of addition between vectors $u$ and $v$, denoted $u+v$, is
  defined in $\cal W$, with the result that *u+v* is also in $\cal W$.
  We describe that latter property by saying $\cal W$ is *closed* under
  addition. `

* Some form of scalar multiplication is defined, so that for any number
  $c$ and and $u$ in $\cal W$, $cw$ exists and is in $\cal W$. 
  We describe that latter property by saying $\cal W$ is *closed* 
  under scalar multiplication

* This being a practical book with just a dash of theory, we'll skip the
  remaining conditions, involving algebraic properties such as
  commutativity of addition ($u+v = v+u$).

</blockquote>

## Examples

### $\cal R^{n}$

In the vast majority of examples in this book, our vector space will be
$\cal R^{n}$.

Here $\cal R$ represents the set of all real numbers, and $\cal R^{n}$ is
simply the set of all vectors consisiting of $n$ real numbers. In an $m
\textrm{x} k$ matrix the rows are members of so $\cal R^{m}$ and the
columns are in $\cal R^{k}$.

### The set of all continuous functions on the interval [0,1]

No surprises here.  Vector addition and scalar multiplication are done
as functions. If say $u$ is the squaring function and $v$$ is the sine
function, then

$$
3u = 3x^{0.5}
$$

and 

$$
u+v = x^{0.5} + sin(x)
$$

### The set of all random variables defined on some probability space

Consider the example in @sec-mlb on major league baseball players.  We
choose a player at random.  Denote weight, height and age by $W$, $H$
and $A$. 

Vector addition and scalar multiplication are defined in a
straightforward manner. For instance, the sum of $H$ and $A$
is simply height + age. This may seem like a rather nonsensical sum, but
it fits the technical definition, and moreover, we have already been
doing things like this! This after all is what is happening in our
prediction expression from that section,

$$
\textrm{predicted weight} =
-187.6382 + 4.9236 H+ 0.9115 A
$$

In fact, in this vector space, the above is a linear combination of the
random variables $1$, $H$ and $A$

## Subspaces

Say $\cal W_{1}$ a subset of a vectpr space $\cal W$, such that $\cal
W_{1}$ is closed under addition and scalar multiplication. $\cal W_{1}$
is called a *subspace* of $\cal W$.

For instance, say $\cal W$ is $R^3$, and take $\cal W_{1}$ to be all
vectors of the form (a,b,0). Clearly, $\cal W_{1}$ is closed under
addition and scalar multiplication.
