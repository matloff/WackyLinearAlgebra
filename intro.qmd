# Introduction and Motivating Examples

To set the stage, consider the following:

## UC Berkeley discrimination claims {#sec-ucb}

UC Berkeley was accused of discriminating against female applicants
for graduate school, and indeed the overall acceptance rate for women
was lower than that for men.  This seemed odd, given Berkeley's liberal
reputation.

However, upon breaking the data down [This data is included in R, as the
built-in dataset **UCBAdmissions**.]{.column-margin} according to the
program students were applying to, it was found that in every
department, the female acceptance rate *within that department* was
either higher than the male rate or of similar level.  The problem:
women were applying to more selective programs, causing their overall
rate to below that of men.
