# Eigenanalysis 

Your Turn: Consider $C(0,1) and the subspace generated by the
polynomials $t^i, i = 0,1,...,k.$ Write a function that calculates and
returns an orthonormal basis for this subspace. Then write a function
which takes that basis as input, and finds the projection onto the
subspace of any f in $C(0,1)$.
