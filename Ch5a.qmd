# Vector Spaces 

::: {.callout-note}

## Goals of this chapter:

As noted earlier, the two main structures in linear algebra are matrices
and vector spaces. We now introduce the latter, a bit more abstract than
matrices but even more powerful.

## Review of matrix rank

In the last chapter, we presented the concepts of matrix row and column
rank, defined to be the maximal number of linearly independent
combinations of the rows or columns of the matrix, respectively. We
proved that

<blockquote>

For any matrix $B$, 

$$
\textrm{rowrank}(B)
= \textrm{colrank}(B)
= \textrm{rowrank}(B_{rref})
= \textrm{colrank}(B_{rref})
$$

</blockquote>

We can say something stronger: 

<blockquote>

Let $\cal V$ denote the set of all possible linear combinations of
rows of $B$, and define $\cal V_{rref}$ similarly. Then

$$
\cal V = \cal V_{rref}
$$

The analogous result holds for columns.

</blockquote>

So, not only do the two matrices have the same maximal numbers of 
linearly independent rows, they also generate *the same linear
combinations*
