# Inner Product Spaces

::: {.callout-note}

## Goals of this chapter:

The usefulness of vector spaces is greatly enhanced with the addition of
an *inner product* structures.  We motivate and define such structures
here, and present applications.

Among other things, we will analyze a method for removing racial, gender
etc. bias in machine learning algorithms.

## Geometric Aspirations

You may recall from your high school geometry course the key concept of
perpendicularity, represented by the ‚ä• symbol. You may also recall that
in 2-dimensional space, given a point P and a line L, the line drawn
from point P to the closest point P' within L is perpendicular to L.
The same is true if L is a plane. The point P' is called the
*projection* of P onto L.

This was shown in this book's cover, shown here:

![Projections](Projections.png)

The point at the end of the green vector is projected onto the
mustard-colored plane, producing the red vector. It in turn is projected
onto the blue line. There are right angles in each case.


The early developers of linear algebra wanted to extend such concepts to
abstract vector spaces. This aids intuition, and has very powerful
applications.

## Definition

You may have seen dot products in a course on vector calculus or
physics. For instance, the dot product of the vectors (3,1,1.5)' and
(0,5,6)' is

3x0 + 1x5 + 1.5x6 = 14

This in fact is a standard inner product on $\cal R^3$, but the general
definition is as follows.

<blockquote>

An *inner product* on a vector space $\cal V$, denoted by the "angle
brackets" notation $<u,v>$, is a function with two vectors as arguments
and a numerical output, with the following properties:

* $<u,v> = <v,u>$

* The function is bilinear: 

  $$
  <u,av+bw> = a <u,v> + b <u,w>
  $$

* $<u,u> \geq 0$, with equality if and only if $u = 0$.

</blockquote>

## Examples

$\cal R^n$:

As noted, ordinary dot product is the most common inner product on this
space.

$<(a_1,...,a_n),(b_1,...,b_n> =
a_1 b_1 + ... + a_n b_n$

*C(0,1)*:

One inner product on this space is

$$
<f,g> = \int_{0}^{1} f(t) g(t) ~ dt
$$  

For instance, with $f(t) = t^2$ and $g(t) = \sin(t)$, the inner product
can be computed with R:

```{r}
f <- function(t) t^2
g <- function(t) sin(t)
fg <- function(t) f(t) * g(t)
integrate(fg,0,1)
```

This clearly fits most requirements for inner products, but what about
$<f,f> = 0$ only if $f = 0$?[Note that the 0 vector in this space is the
function that is identically 0, not just 0 at some points]{.column-margin}
A non-0 $f$ will have $f^2(t) > 0$ for at least one $t$, and by
continuity, $f^2(t) > 0$ on an interval containing that $t$, thus making
a nonzero contribution to the integral and thus to the inner product.


$\cal RV(\Omega)$:

From here on, we'll restrict to the vector space of all random variables
on $\Omega$ having finite variance. We define

$$
<X,Y> = E(XY)
$$

The properties of expected value, e.g. linearity, show that the
requirements for an inner product hold.  

## Norm of a Vector

This concept extends the notion of a the length of a vector, as we know
it in $\cal R^2$ and $\cal R^3$.

*Definition:*

<blockquote>

The *norm* of a vector $x$, denoted $||x||$, is

$$
(<x,x>)^{0.5}
$$

The *distance* from a vector $x$ to a vector $y$ is

$$
||y - x||
$$

</blockquote>

## The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

::: {#thm-cs}

## Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

Say $u$ and $v$ are vectors in an inner product space. Then

$$
|<u,v>| \leq ||u|| ~ ||v||
$$

:::

::: {.proof}

See the Your Turn problem below.

:::

### Application: Correlation{#sec-corr}

*Correlation coefficients* are ubiquitous in data science. It is well
known that their values fall into the interval [-1,1]. Let's prove that.

Recall from @sec-cov the notion of the covariance between two random
variables (from which the covariance matrix of a random vector is
formed). We remarked that covariance is intuitively like correlation,but
that latter is a scaled form. Formally,

$$
\rho(X,Y) =
\frac{E[(X-EX)(Y-EY)]}{\sqrt{Var(X)} \sqrt{Var(Y)}}
$$

By dividing the covariance by the product of the standard deviations, we
obtain a unitless quantity, i.e. free of units such as centimeters and
degrees.

Now, $X$ and $Y$ are in $\cal RV(\Omega)$. To simplify the algebra,
consider the case $EX = EY = 0$.[Actually, we should say, 
``Make the transformation $X \rightarrow X - EX$,
and note that it leaves both sides of the above correlation formula
unchanged. We can thus assume $EX = EY = 0$.'' This is a common strategy,
and should be kept in mind.]{.column-margin}

Recalling our inner product for this space, we have

$$
<X,Y> = E(XY)
$$

and 

$$
||X||^2 = <X,X> = E(X^2) = Var(X)
$$

with the analogous relations for $Y$.

Cauchy=Schwarz then says

$$
|E(XY)| \leq \sqrt{Var(X)} \sqrt{Var(Y)}
$$

which says the correlation is between -1 and 1 inclusive.

## The Triangle Inequality

In the world of ordinary physical geometry, we know the following

*The distance from A to B is less than or equal to the sum of the
distances from A to C and C to B.* This is true as well in general,
abstract inner product spaces.

::: {#thm-triangle}

## Triangle Inequality

In a general inner product space,

$$
||x - z|| \leq ||x - y|| + ||y - z|| 
$$

:::

::: {.proof}

See the Your Turn problem below.

:::

## Projections{#sec-projections}

As mentioned, the extension of classical geometry to abstract vector
spaces has powerful applications. There is no better example of this
than the idea of *projections*.

### Theorem

We say that vectors $u$ and $v$ are *orthogonal* if $<u,v> = 0$. This is
the general extension of the notion of perpendicularity in high school
geometry. Then we have the following:

::: {#thm-projection}

## Projection Theorem

Consider an inner product space $\cal V$, with subspace $\cal W$.  Then
for any vector $x$ in $\cal V$, there is a unique vector $z$ in $\cal
W$, such that $z$ is the closest vector to $x$ in $\cal W$. 

Furthermore, $x-z$ is orthogonal to any vector $r$ in $\cal W$.

:::

The full proof is beyond the scope of this book, as it requires
background in real analysis. Indeed, even the statement of the theorem
is not mathematically tight.[For readers who do have such background,
this is the Hilbert Projection Theorem. "Closest" is defined in terms of
infimum, and $\cal W$ needs to be a topologically closed
set. See for example [the Wikipedia entry.l](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_projection_theorem)]{.column-margin}

For example, in the case of $R^n$, It will be seen shortly that for each
$\cal W$ in the theorem, there is a matrix $P_{W}$ that implements the
projection, i.e.

$$
z = P_W x
$$

Note that projection operators are *idempotent*, meaning that if you
apply a projection twice, the effect is the same as applying it once. In
the matrix equation above, this means $P_W^2 = P_W$. This makes sense;
once you drop down to the subspace, there is no further dropping down to
that same space.

### The Pythagorean Theorem

That this ancient theorem in geometry still holds in general inner
product spaces is a tribute to the power of abstraction.

::: {#thm-pythag}

If vectors $X$ and $Y$ are orthogonal, then

$$
||X+Y||^2 = ||X||^2 + ||Y||^2
$${#eq-pythag}

:::

::: {.proof}

Replace the norms by expression in inner products. Simplify using
properties of inner product.

## Projections in $\cal RV(\Omega)$

The material here is rather involved, consisting of applying inner
product spaces to various probability calculations. Since $\cal
RV(\Omega)$ is a vector space of random variables, the focus below will
sometimes be on such an entity as a random variable but at other times will
view it as a member of a vector space.

The reader may skip this section without affecting the ability to learn the
sequel.  But you are urged to work through it, as it is an excellent
example of a very abstract vector space that is useful in practical
applications, such as will be presented in @sec-fairness. It is
mathematical but not deep, and should be accessible to all readers.

We will need to build a bit of infrastructure.

### Conditional expectation

One of the Your Turn problems at the end of this chapter covers this
setting: 

> Say we roll a die once, producing $X$ dots. If $X = 6$,
> we get a bonus roll, yielding $B$ additional dots; otherwise, $B = 0$.
> Let $Y = X+B$.

*The basic form:*

Now, what is $E(Y | B = 2)$? If $B = 2$, then we got the bonus roll, so
$X = 6$ and $Y = X + B = 8$:

$$
E(Y | B = 2) = 8
$$

The quantity $E(Y | B = 1)$ and so on are handled similarly.

What about $E(Y | B = 0)$? Here, alas, we did not get a bonus roll. If
that is all we know, then $Y$ could be any of 1,2,3,4,5,6 with each
probability, thus mean 3.5.

In other words,

$$
E(Y | B = i) =
\begin{cases}
3.5 & i = 0 \\
6 + i & i = 1,2,3,4,5
\end{cases}
$$

*The random variable form:*

The quantity $E(Y | B = i)$, a number, can be converted to a random
variable, in the form of a function of $B$, which we will call $q$(B), and 
denoted $E(Y | B)$, where

$$
q(B) = 
\begin{cases}
3.5 & B = 0 \\
6 + B & B = 1,2,3,4,5
\end{cases}
$$

$B$ is random, so $q(B)$ is also random, and here is its distribution:

> $$
> q(B) \textrm{ takes on the values } 3,7,8,9,10,11 \textrm{ with
> probabilities } 
> $$
> $$
> 1/6, 1/36, 1/36, 1/36, 1/36, 1/36
> $$ 

We need one more thing:

*The Law of Iterated Expectation:*

For random variables $U$ and $V$, set

$$
R = E[V |U]
$$

Then 

$$
E(R) = E(V)
$$

More concisely:

$$
E[E(V|U)] = E(V)
$${#eq-iterexpect}

Intuitive explanation: Say we wish to compute the mean height $E(H)$ of
all students at a university. We might ask each department $D$ to
measure their own students, and report to us the resulting mean $E(H|D)$. 
We could then average all those departmental means to get the overall
mean for the university:

$$
E[E(H|D)] = E(H)
$$

Note, though that that outer $E()$ (the first 'E') is a weighted
average, since some departments are larger than others. The weights are
the distribution of $D$.

### Projections in $\cal RV(\Omega)$: how they work

Consider random variables $X$ and $Y$. Let $W$ be the set of all
functions of $X$ with finite variance, which is a subspace of the vector
space $\cal RV(\Omega)$. @thm-projection talks of a closest vector $C$ in
$W$ to $Y$. Note that $C$, being a member of $\cal RV(\Omega)$, is a
random variable.  Let's see what form $C$ might take. 

Remember, the (squared) distance from $Y$ to $C$ is

$$
||Y - C||^2 = <Y-C,Y-C> = E[(Y-C)^2]
$$

By the Law of Iterated Expectation, that last term is 

$$
E[ E((Y-C)^2 | X) ]
$$

For any random variable $Q$ of finite variance, the minimum value of
$E[(Q-d)^2]$ over all constants $d$ is attained by $d = E(Q)$. (See Your
Turn problem below.) So, the minimum of $E((Y-C)^2 | X)$, is attained by
the conditional mean,[Note that since we are conditioning on the random
variable $C$, it becomes a constant, like $d$ above.]{.column-margin}

$$
C = E(Y | X)
$$

In other words:

> Projections in $\cal RV(\Omega)$ are conditional means.

Moreover:

Since the difference between a vector and its projection onto a subspace
is orthogonal to that subspace, and since in $\cal RV(\Omega)$
orthogonality means 0 correlation, we have:

> The vector $Y - E(Y|X)$ is uncorrelated with $E(Y|X)$.  In other words,
> the prediction error (also called the *residual*) has 0 correlation with
> the prediction itself.

## Projections in the Linear Model

The case of the linear model will deepen our understanding, and will
lead to a method for outlier detection that is commonly used in
practice.

### The least-squares solution is a projection

Armed with our new expertise on inner product spaces, we see that
@eq-matrixss is

$$
<S-Ab,S-Ab>
$$

in the vector space $R^n$, where $n$ is the number of our data
points.[Of course, "data points" means rows in the data frame.  In the
statistics realm, people often speak of "observations."]{.column-margin}
Since we are minimizing that quantity with respect to $b$, the solution,
$A \widehat{\beta}$, is the projection of $Y$ onto the subspace.

But wait -- *what* subspace?  Well, it is the subspace consisting of all
vectors of the form $Ab$:

<blockquote>

The linear model projects the vector $Y$ onto the column space of $A$.

</blockquote>

### Application: identifying outliers

An *outlier* is a data point that is rather far from the others. It
could be an error, or simply an anomalous case. Even in the latter
situation, such a data point could distort our results, so in both
cases, identifying outliers is important.

Recall @eq-linregformula, the general solution to our linear regression
model: 

$$
\widehat{\beta} = (A'A)^{-1} A'S
$$

The projection itself is then 

$$
A \widehat{\beta} = A(A'A)^{-1} A'S = HS
$$

where the matrix 

$$
H = A(A'A)^{-1} A'
$$ 

which projects $S$ onto the column space of $A$, is called the *hat
matrix*. 

As a projection, $H$ is idempotent, which one can easily verify by
multiplication.  $H$ is also symmetric.

Let $h_{ii}$ denote element $i$ of the diagonal of $H$, with $x_i$
denoting row $i$ of A. One can show that

$$
h_{ii} = x_{i} (A'A)^{-1} x_i'
$${#eq-hii}

The quantity $h_{ii}$ is called the *leverage* for datapoint $i$.

Ah, so we know $h_{ii} \geq 0$.  But also, using the material on
circular shifts in @sec-trace, we have

$$
tr(H) = 
tr[\underbrace{A(A'A)^{-1}} A'] =
tr[A'\underbrace{A(A'A)^{-1}}] = tr(I) = p
$$

for $A$ of size $n \textrm{x} p$.

Thus the average value of $h_{ii}$ is $p/n$. Accordingly, we might
suspect an outlier if $h_{ii}$ is considerably larger than $p/n$. 

For example, let's look at the census data we've seen earlier:

```{r}
library(qeML)
data(mlb1)
ourData <- as.matrix(mlb1[,-1]) # must have matrix to enable %*%
A <- cbind(1,ourData[,c(1,3)])
dim(A)
S <- as.vector(mlb1[,3])
H <- A %*% solve(t(A) %*% A) %*% t(A)
hist(diag(H))
```

The ratio $p/n$ here is 3/1015, about 0.003. We might take a look at the 
observations having $h_{ii}$ above 0.01, say.

## Orthogonal Bases

It turns out that a basis for a vector space is especially useful if its
members are orthogonal to each other.  We'll see why, and see how to
generate such a basis from a nonorthogonal one.

An orthogonal basis in which every vector has length 1 is called
*orthonormal*. Recall that $x \neq 0$ then $x/||x||$ has length 1,
so that any orthogonal basis can easily be converted to orthonormal.

### Motivation

Say we have a vector space $\cal V$, a subspace $\cal W$, and a vector
$x$ in $\cal V$. We know $x$ has a projection in $\cal W$; call it $z$. But
how do we find $z$?

Let $u_1,...,u_k$ be a basis for $\cal W$.[So we are assuming $\cal W$
(but not necessarily $\cal V$ is finite-dimensional. Using proper math,
this could be extended.]{.column-margin} Then there exist $a_1,...,a_k$
such that

$$
z = a_1 u_1 + ..., + a_k u_k
$${#eq-aiui}

So we can find $z$ by finding the $a_i$.

### The virtues of orthogonality

We do have a hint to work from: We know that $x-z$ is orthogonal to
every vector in $\cal W$ -- including the $u_i$. So

$$
0 = <x-z,u_i> = <x,u_i> - <z,u_i>
$$

Thus

$$
<x,u_i> = <z,u_i>
$$

Now, say the $u_i$ are orthogonal to each other, and let's also say they
are length 1. Then $<z,u_i> = a_i$,

so 

$$
<x,u_i> = a_i
$$

So, we're done! We want to determine the $a_i$, and now we see that we
can easily obtain it by calculating $<x,u_i>$.  So, we have:

<blockquote>

Given: a vector space $\cal V$; a subspace $\cal W$ with orthonormal
basis $u_1,...,u_k$; and a vector
$x$ in $\cal V$. Then the projection of $x$ onto $\cal V$ is equal to

$$
p = <x,u_1> u_1+...+<x,u_k> u_k.
$${#eq-orthoproj}

And, as a projection, we have that $x-p$ is orthogonal to all the $u_i$.

</blockquote>


But how do we obtain an orthogonal basis, if we only 
have a nonorthogonal one? That's next...

### The Gram-Schmidt Method{#sec-gramschmidt}

As seen in the last section, it is desirable to have an orthogonal
basis, and it's even more convenient if its vectors have length 1 (an
*orthonormal* basis). Converting to length 1 is trivial -- just divide
the vector by its length.  

But if we start with a basis $b_i$ and generate, say, orthogonal, length
1 vectors $u_1,...,u_m$, how do we get $u_{m+1}$ from $b_{m+1}$?  the
answer lies in @eq-orthoproj: Take the projection $q$ of $b_{m+1}$ onto the
subspace generated by $u_1,...,u_m$; $b_{m+1}-q$ will be orthogonal to
$u_1,...,u_m$, so we can take $u_{m+1}$ to be $b_{m+1}-q$! We then 
normalize it.

So, here is the process for conversion:

<blockquote>

*The Gram-Schmidt Method*

Say we have a basis $b_1,...,b_k$ for some vector space. Convert it to
an orthonormal basis as follows.

1. Set $u_1 = b_1/||b_1||$.

2. For each $i = 2,...,k$, find the projection $q$ of $b_{i}$ onto the
   subspace generated by $u_1,...,u_{i-1}$. Set $u_i$ to $b_i-q$, and
   normalize.

</blockquote>

## Orthogonal Complements and Direct Sums

Consider a subspace $W$ of an inner product space $V$. The set of
vectors having inner product 0 with vectors in $W$ is denoted
$W^{\perp}$, known as the *orthogonal complement* of $W$.  It too is a
subpace, and jointly $W$ and $W^{\perp}$ span all of $V$.

From @sec-projections, we know that for any $x$ in $V$, one can uniquely
write

$$
x = x_1 + x_2
$$

where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are in $W$ and $W^{\perp}$, respectively.

Say $u_1,...,u_r$ and $v_1,...,v_s$ are bases for $W$ and $W^{\perp}$.
Then together they form a basis for all of $V$. Typically they are
chosen to be orthonormal.

Finally, we say that $V$ is the *direct sum* of $W$ and $W^{\perp}$,
denoted $V = W \oplus W^{\perp}$.

## Application: Racial, Gender Etc. Fairness in Algorithms{#sec-fairness}

COMPAS is a software tool designed to aid judges in determining
sentences in criminal trials, by assessing the probability that the
defendant would recidivate. It is a commercial product by Northpointe.

COMPAS came under intense scrutiny after [an
investigation](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing)
by *ProPublica*, which asserted evidence of racial bias against black
defendants compared to white defendants with similar profiles.
Northpointe contested these findings, asserting that their software
treated black and white defendants equally.

It should be noted the *ProPublica* did not accuse Northpointe of
intentional bias. Instead, the issue largely concerns *proxies*,
variables that are related to race, rather than race (or gender etc.)
itself. If for example COMPAS were to use a person's home location as a
predictor, that would be correlated to race, and thus would be unfair to
use in prediction. On the other hand, if the prediction tool makes use
of the number of prior criminal convictions, that would be reasonable,
even though it too might be a proxy for race. 

On the other hand, even using race indirectly for any reason would
likely be unacceptable.  While this book does not take a position on the
specific dispute, this case highlights the critical importance of
addressing fairness in machine learning.

### Setting

We consider prediction of a variable $Y$ from a feature vector $X$ and a
vector of sensitive variables $S$. The target $Y$ may be either numeric
(in a regression setting) or dichotomous (in a two-class classification
setting where $Y$ = 1 or $Y$ = 0). The $m$-class case can be handled
using $m$ dichotomous variables. We will consider only the numeric case here.

Our goal is to reduce or eliminate the influence of the sensitive 
variable $S$. One might ask, why not simply remove $S$ from our
model-fitting process? The problem is that $X$ may include variables
that are related to $S$. In the COMPAS example, race has some
correlation with another variable, number of prior convictions.

### The method of Scutari *et al*

The basic assumption (BA) amounts to $(Y,X,S)$ having a multivariate
Gaussian distribution, with $Y$ scalar and $X$ being a vector of length
$p$.  For convenience, assume here that $S$ is scalar.  As in @sec-corr,
all variables are assumed centered, i.e. mean 0.

Let's review the material in @sec-mvn: Say we have $W$ with a
multivariate normal distribution, and wish to predict one of its
components, $Y$, from a vector $X$ consisting of one or more of the
other components, or linear combinations of them. Then

* the distribution of $Y|X$ is univeriate normal

* E(Y|X=t) is a linear function of $t$

* Var(Y|X=t) is independent of $t$

Let's add:

* though having 0 correlation does not in general imply independence, it
  does so in the multivariate normal case

One first applies a linear model in regressing $X$ on $S$,

$$
E(X | S) = S \gamma 
$$

where $\gamma$ is a length-$p$ coefficient vector. Here we are
predicting the predictors (of $Y$), seemingly odd, but a first step in
ridding ourselves from the influence of $S$.

Now consider the prediction errors (*residuals)*,

$$
U = X - S \gamma 
$$

$U$ can be viewed as the part of $X$ that is unrelated to $S$; think of
$U$ as "having no $S$ content." Note that $U$ is a vector of length $p$.

Note the following:

* $E(X|S)$ is the projection of $X$ onto the subspace of all functions
  of $S$.

* $X - E(X|S)$ (original vector minus the projection) is orthogonal to $S$.

* That is, 

  $$
  0 = <S,X - E(X|S)> = E[S (X - E(X|S))] = E(SU)
  $$

* Thus $S$ and $U$ are uncorrelated.

* Due to the BA, that means $S$ and $U$ are independent.

* In other words, our intution above that $U$ "has no $S$ content" 
  was mathematically correct.

* Bottom line: Instead of predicting $Y$ from $X$, use $U$ as the
  predictor vector.  This will enable truly $S$-free prediction.

Goal achieved.

## Your Turn

‚ùÑÔ∏è  **Your Turn:** Consider the space $\cal RV(\Omega)$. In order for the
claimed inner product to be valid, we must have that if $<X,X> = 0$,
then $X$ must be the 0 vector. Prove this. Make use of the facts that
$Var(X) = E(X^2) - [E(X)]^2$ and $Var(X) \geq 0$ with equality only of
$X = c$ for some constant $c$.

following algebraic outline:

* The inequality

  $$
  0 \leq <(au+v),(au+v)>
  $$

  holds for any scalar $a$.

* Expand the right-hand side (RHS), using the bilinear property of inner 
  products.

* Minimize the resulting RHS with respect to $a$.

* Collect terms to yield

   $$
   <u,v>^2 \leq ||u||^2 ||v||^2
   $$

‚ùÑÔ∏è  **Your Turn:** Consider a set of vectors $W = {v_1,...,v_k}$ in an
inner product space $V$. Let $U$ be another vector in $V$. Show that
there exist scalars $a_1,...,a_k$ and a vector $v$ such that

$$
u = a_1 v_1 + ... + a_k v_k +v 
$$

with

$$
<v,v_i> = 0 \textrm{ for all i}
$$

‚ùÑÔ∏è  **Your Turn:** Say in $C(0,1)$ we want to approximate functions by 
polynomials. Specifically, for any $f$ in $C(0,1)$, we want to find the
closest polynomial of degree $m$. Write functions to do this, with the
following call forms:

``` r
gsc01(m)  # performs Gram-Schmidt and returns the result
bestpoly(f,gsout)  # approx. f by output from gsc01

```

Hint: Since the vectors here are functions, you'll need a data structure
capable of storing functions. An R **list** will work well here.

of your own choosing, verify that the Cauchy-Schwarz and Triangle
Inequalities hold in that case.

‚ùÑÔ∏è  **Your Turn:** Say we roll a die once, producing $X$ dots. If $X = 6$,
we get a bonus roll, yielding $B$ additional dots; otherwise, $B = 0$.
Let $Y = X+B$. Verify that $X$ and $B$ satisfy the Cauchy-Schwarz and
Triangle Inequalities, and also find $\rho(X,B)$.

‚ùÑÔ∏è  **Your Turn:** Show that any set of orthogonal vectors is linearly
independent.

‚ùÑÔ∏è  **Your Turn:** Prove @eq-pythag by expanding the inner product and
simplifying algebraically.

‚ùÑÔ∏è  **Your Turn:** Prove @thm-triangle. 

‚ùÑÔ∏è  **Your Turn:** Prove that the vector $Y - E(Y|X)$ is uncorrelated
with $E(Y|X)$

‚ùÑÔ∏è  **Your Turn:** For $X$ and $Y$ in $\cal RV(\Omega$, prove that

$$
Var(Y) = E[Var(Y|X)] + Var[E(Y|X)],
$$

first algebraically using @eq-iterexpect and the relation $Var(R) =
E(R^2) - (E(R))^2$, and then using the Pythagorean Theorem for a much
quicker proof.  As before, assume $X$ and $Y$ are centered.

‚ùÑÔ∏è  **your turn:** show that @eq-hii holds. 

‚ùÑÔ∏è  **Your Turn:** Say $\cal V$ is $R^n$. Form the matrix $A$ whose
columns are the $u_i$, and let $P = AA'$. Show that

$$
Px = <x,u_1> u_1+...+<x,u_k> u_k
$$

so that $P$ thereby implements the projection.

‚ùÑÔ∏è  **Your Turn:** Consider the quadratic form $x'Px$. Show that if $P$ 
is a projection matrix, the form equals $||Px||^2$.

‚ùÑÔ∏è  **Your Turn:** Let $A$ be an $m \textrm{ x } n$ matrix. Consider the
possible inner product on $\cal{R}^n$ defined by $<x,y> = x'A'A y$.
State a condition on $A$ that is necessary and sufficient for the
claimed inner product to be value, and prove this.
