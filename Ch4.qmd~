# Matrix Rank, and Vector Spaces Part I 

In our computations in the latter part of the last chapter, we added a
proviso that $(A'A)^{-1}$ exists. In this chapter, we'll present a
counterexample, which will naturally lead into our covering matrix rank and
the basics of vector spaces.

## Example: census data

This dataset is also from **qeML**. It is data for Silicon Valley
engineers in the 2000 Census. Let's focus on just a few columns.

```{r}
data(svcensus) 
head(svcensus) 
svc <- svcensus[,c(1,4:6)] 
head(svc) 
lm(wageinc ~ .,data=svc) 
```

So, we estimate that, other factors being equal, men about paid close to
\$11,000 more than women. This is a complex issue, but for our purposes
here, how did **gender** become **gendermale**, no explicit mention of
women?

Let's try to force the issue:

```{r}
svc$man <- as.numeric(svc$gender == 'male')
svc$woman <- as.numeric(svc$gender == 'female')
svc$gender <- NULL
head(svc)
lm(wageinc ~ .,data=svc)
```

Well, we couldn't force the issue after all. Why not? We hinted above
that $A' A$ may not be invertible. Let's check its row-reduced form.

```{r}
A <- cbind(1,svc[,-2])
A <- as.matrix(A)
ApA <- t(A) %*% A
ApA
library(pracma)
rref(ApA) 
```

Aha! The row reduction process ended prematurely. This matrix has no
inverse. We say that the matrix has *rank* 4, when it needs to be 5;
we also say that $A'A$ is not of *full rank*.

Recall that in the nonfull rank example we presented in the last
chapter, one row was double another. Here the sum of the last two
columns of $A$ was equal to the first column. We say the columns are
*linearly dependent*. This is the culprit in non-full rank matrices.

In fact, not only was $A'A$ not of full rank, but so was $A$:

```{r}
qr(ApA)$rank
qr(A)$rank
```

This is rather startling. $A$ has over 20,000 rows --- yet only 4
linearly independent ones?[There are many subsets of 4 rows that are
linearly independent. But no sets of 5 or more are linearly independent.

<blockquote>

For any $rxs$ matix $G$, the rank of $B$ is less than or equal to 
$\min(r,s)$.

</blockquote>

Details to follow.
